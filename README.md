Synchronizer Token Pattern 

Download or clone the project.
install xampp web server.
open xampp control panel and run 'Apache' service.
open Eclipse ide. 
select '\xampp\htdocs' or to the htdocs folder where you installed XAMP as Workspace. 
(You can set up a Workspace anywhere but the simplest option is to place it within the folder structure of the web server. The reason is that when you come to run your PHP program Eclipse will generate a URL and expect the web server to find the file and serve it to the browser)
If you are running project in Eclipse you need to install PDT tools from Eclipse Market Place.
open project in eclipse.
Then right click on project and select 'Run As' option and finally you can run project as PHP Web Application.
